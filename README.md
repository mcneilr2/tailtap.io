# TailTap.io

## Overview

My app is primarily used to connect skateboarders to each other by providing a platform for sharing information about skateboarding locations, and most importantly: sharing trick footage.

### Problem Space

The problem space is defined by a general lack of tech enabled products marketed towards skateboarders, or towards the skatebaording community in general.  There is no question that investment in the sport is justified (Vanity Fair purchased Vans in the early 2000, skateboarding entered the Olympics in 2020), but that investment seems decidedly directed at corporate support, rather than in the community itself.  Therfore the problem space is defined as a lack of tech-enabled products directed at enabling new, current and potential skateboarders.

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Add any special considerations that your app must take into account.
Who? Anyone wishing to learn to skateboard, or anyone who wants to continue learning to skateboard.

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

1) Person 1 (Alex): Alex is an intermediate skateboarder.  He loves to skate when he travels for work, so he always brings his board w him.
He loves to try new parks when he travels, so hes always trying to look up photos/videos of people skating in the areas hes going.
Hes travelling to Vancouver for a conference in November, and he really wants to get some great skate footage while hes there.  
He dowloads TailTap.io and finds a map on the main page.  He finds the general area near his hotel on the app and sees that there are 2
skateparks and 5 street spots within 10 minutes skate of his hotel.  He really wants to skate bowl this weekend so he uses a filter bar tools
filter for locations with bowl features, which narrows it down to the 2 parks.  Alex is autistic, so loud, busy parks are not his thing.
He sees that one of the 2 parks has the highest rating for "business" at this time and the average skill level is listed as "high".  Alex
decides to skate at the other park instead, which has a rating of "quiet" with an average skill level of "intermediate".  He gets there,
and enjoys himself skating the bowl and taking photos of the cool graphiti.  He makes a new friend at the skatepark and thay add each other on TailTap
and Instagram.  Alex and his new friend film each other skating the bowl and post it on tailtap under the park's page for the next friends to find.


2) Person 2(Devon): Devon has never skateboarded before.  They think it looks really fun, and they got a skateboard for their birthday, but
they are not sure of where to begin, or where to go where they can practice.  They download the TailTap.io app and look for skatespots in their
area.  They find a skatespot with a good reviews for beginners, so they go to the spot page.  They find that there is an LGBTQAI+ group
for beginners that meets there every sunday.  Excited to meat new friends, Devon finds the queer group admins on instagram through TailTap
and messages them asking if anyone in the group knows ASL.  The admin informs them that they don't have anyone in the group that is deaf, but
they know a really awesome deaf skateboarder in New York that has some awesome footage.  Devon adds this person on TailTap and messages them
saying they are starting out and really excited.  Devon is excited to go to the next skate meetup and start trying some of the tricks they
have seen their new friend doing on TailTap in New York.


3) Person 3(Naaba): Naaba is in her 50's lives in Vancouver with teenage kids.  Her son loves skateboarding, and she has started standing on 
the skateboard while her son holds her hands when he brings out the skateboard to the living room.  She really likes the feeling of balancing on the board,
and how fluid she feels moving back and forth between turns while she laughs with her son.  She would love to be able to skateboard with him
 down the street, but she has never seen anyone that looks like her on a skateboard, and she doesnt know if she has the right shoes.
 Her son recommends the TailTap app, and she downloads it onto her phone.  She looks up spots in her area, and sees a local skatepark that
 has great reviews for beginners.  She notices that a few of the videos from the spot are posted by another woman in the area that looks
 about her age.  She messages the woman on TailTap and it turns out, she is also a mom in the area who has been skating for years.  Nabaa
 makes fast friends with the other skate mom, and they meet up each saturday afternoon to have lunch and practice skateboarding together
 at the park.  Naaba doesn't like to do tricks, but thouroughly enjoys cruising around the park while her friend tries new tricks.  Each week,
 they post new pictures at the park together, and 2 weeks ago, another mom decided to join them after Naaba told her how much fun they
 were having.
